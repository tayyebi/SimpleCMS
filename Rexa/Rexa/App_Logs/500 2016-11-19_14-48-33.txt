Source: System.Web.WebPages.Razor
Message: Expected a "{" but found a "<".  Block statements must be enclosed in "{" and "}".  You cannot use single-statement control-flow statements in CSHTML pages. For example, the following is not allowed:

@if(isLoggedIn)
    <p>Hello, @user</p>

Instead, wrap the contents of the block in "{}":

@if(isLoggedIn) {
    <p>Hello, @user</p>
}
